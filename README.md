# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It demonstrates how to handle imbalanced datasets, perform data preprocessing, and apply classification models to real-world fraud detection problems.       
Credit card fraud is a significant financial issue worldwide. This project analyzes a dataset of European card transactions to build a predictive model that can classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Dataset Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Records: 284,807 transactions

Fraudulent transactions: 492 (0.17%)

(Note: Due to confidentiality, features are PCA-transformed except for Time and Amount.)

Model Performance:
The notebook includes confusion matrices,Precision and recall scores ROC and AUC curves Insights on how different models perform with imbalanced classes.

Results & Future Work: This project highlights the challenges of imbalanced classification and how models like Random Forest can handle them effectively.

Future improvements: Try SMOTE or other advanced resampling techniques, Experiment with ensemble methods and hyperparameter tuning, Deploy the model as an API for real-time fraud detection.
